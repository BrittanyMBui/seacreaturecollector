The Sea Creature Collector -

App was built using HTML, CSS, Django, Materialize, PostgreSql

This app is meant to be somewhat lighthearted as well as educational. A user can create an account and go in and upload photos and names/species/descriptions of sea creatures. A user can also add feedings for their sea creatures, including four different types of meals and a breakfast, lunch or dinner option. If the creature hasn't eaten in a while, a prompt will display that the creature needs to be fed. After all three meals are given for the day, the prompt returns to normal. Users can also edit or delete their sea creatures.

I hope to add features such as a delete photo functionality, a 'clear all' function for the feeding logs, and polish up some styling.
