The Sea Creature Collector -

App was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Materialize, PostgreSql

<<<<<<< HEAD
This application doesnâ€™t necessarily have any real world use-case, however it is somewhat lighthearted and educational/entertaining. The meals/feeding form is a virtually useless feature that I mostly replicated from the CatCollector project but I thought it would add a touch of humor with the displayed conditional statement.
=======
This app is meant to be somewhat lighthearted as well as educational. A user can create an account and go in and upload photos and names/species/descriptions of sea creatures. A user can also add feedings for their sea creatures, including four different types of meals and a breakfast, lunch or dinner option. If the creature hasn't eaten in a while, a prompt will display that the creature needs to be fed. After all three meals are given for the day, the prompt returns to normal. Users can also edit or delete their sea creatures.

User Story:
 A user can create an account as a sea creature collector. Once created and logged in, they can upload photos and the names/species/descriptions of sea creatures. A user can also add feedings for their sea creatures, including four different types of weird oceanic meals and a breakfast, lunch or dinner option. If the creature hasn't eaten in a while, a prompt will display that the creature needs to be fed. After all three meals are given for the day, the prompt returns to normal. User's can also edit or delete their sea creatures.

I hope to add features such as a delete photo functionality (halfway there), a 'clear all' function for the feeding logs, a 'delete account' feature, and polish up some styling.
